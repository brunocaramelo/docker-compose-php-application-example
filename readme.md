## Requirements
    - Docker
    - Docker Daemon (Service)
    - Docker Compose

## Installation Procedures
    Application Installation Procedures for Local Use

1- Download repository 
    
2 - Check if doors 80 and 3306 are occupied.

3 - Enter the base directory of the application and execute the commands below:
    
    0 - cp docker/docker-compose-env/database.env.example docker/docker-compose-env/database.env
        - cp docker/docker-compose-env/application.env.example docker/docker-compose-env/application.env
        - cp docker/docker-compose-env/messagequeue.env.example docker/docker-compose-env/messagequeue.env

    1 - sudo docker-compose up -d; (READ OBSERVATION)

    2 - sudo docker exec -t php-library-example php /app/artisan migrate;

    3 - sudo docker exec -t php-library-example php /app/artisan db:seed;

    4 - sudo docker exec -t php-library-example php /app/artisan key:generate;
    

    
#### Description of the Steps

    1 - for the images to be stored and executed and to upload the instances
        
        (OBSERVATION) - due to the delay of the composer in bringing the dependencies, there are 3 alternatives,
        
            1 - EXECUTE sudo docker-compose up; without being daemon the first time, so that it is possible to check the progress of the installation of dependencies.
            
            2 - Wait about 20 minutes or a little more for the command to be effective. in order to avoid autoload for example.
            
            3 - In case you have any problem of Dependencies, execute the command below to guarantee them.
                sudo docker exec -t php-library-example composer install;
    
    2 - so that the framework manages and applies the mapping to the database (SQL) can be Mysql, PostGres , Oracle , SQL Serve or SQLITE for example
    
    3 - for the framework to apply changes to the database data, in the case of a first user insertion.
    
    4 - generation of hash key to use the system as validation key.
    
    5 - for the framework to execute the test suite.
        - API tests  
        - unit tests
     
### Resolution of possible problems:

#### Problems with dependencies/autoload (Step 1)
    Due to the delay of the composer in bringing the dependencies, there are 3 alternatives,
        
            1 - EXECUTE sudo docker-compose up; without being daemon the first time, so that it is possible to check the progress of the installation of dependencies.
            
            2 - Wait about 20 minutes or a little more for the command to be effective. in order to avoid autoload errors for example.
            
            3 - In case you have any problem with dependencies, execute the command below to guarantee them.
                sudo docker exec -t php-library-example composer install;

#### Problems with Webserver permission to the exposed volume (Step 6)
    - The same may have webserver permission problems at volume /app (or subdirectories)
      Even though it is not indicated, but because it is a local environment, the forced execution of permissions can be done with:
       - sudo docker-compose exec web chmod 777 -R /app
